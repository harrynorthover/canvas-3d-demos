'canvas3d' is a selection of 3D HTML5 Canvas demos created using my 3D engine, Blur3D.

Blur3D is located in 'engine/' and is still in its very early stages at the moment and not ready for production.

All the demos I created are under 'test/'. 

If you want to see my latest demo, one using Blur3D & Websockets then checkout Sketchpad - https://github.com/harrynorthover/sketchpad
